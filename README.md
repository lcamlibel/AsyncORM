Async ORM
========
A very lightweight dynamic asynchronous data access for .NET, written in C#. 


Supported Platform and Database Server
==========================================
The project only supports .NET 4.5 and Sql Server.

Why do you need this another micro ORM?
=====================
.NET 4.5 and C# 5.0 allow us to utilize asynchronous programming as a core feature of the .NET Framework, and ADO.NET takes full advantage of the standard design patterns.
AsyncORM allows developers  to develop asynchronous data access without dealing with the complexity.
